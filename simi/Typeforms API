Accessing Results / Making Requests

Once you’ve got the UID of the typeform and your API key, you’ve got everything you need to start making requests to the Data API, and start fetching your results.

The URL of your request takes the following format:

https://api.typeform.com/v1/form/[typeform_UID]?key=[your_API_key]
https://api.typeform.com/v1/form/IkA8x2?key=52bc074ab498f5f65b97fa7dc625b9d9915b3d4d



for(var i = 0;i <48;i++){

}
